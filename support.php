<h2>Crypto-coins</h2>


<p>Crypto-coins are online digital currencies based on an open-source, peer-to-peer encryption protocol first described in 2009 with the introduction of the Bitcoin (BTC) created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. Crypto currencies are not managed by any government or central authority, but relies on a P2P Internet-based network that registers the transactions.</p>
<p>If you are in possession of bitcoins or any of the other currencies shown below, the author will gladly accept a hand-out, as he is very interested in the BLOCK-CHAIN these days. If you are into this you probably know what to do.</p>

<?php echo $cryptocoins; ?>
