<h3>Katharsisdrill</h3>
<p>The cartoon about <em>Phill from GCHQ</em> is written and drawn by the Scandinavian artist Katharsisdrill. The first three pages were originally published as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons-by</a> at <a href="https://www.datataffel.dk/u/katharsisdrill">his profile on the decentralized social network Diaspora.</a> The comic was not supposed to be continued, but by popular demand (on the Diaspora network that means five people) Katharsisdrill decided to make a few more pages. This website is the result.</p>

<h3>Phill Philby</h3>
<p>Phill is a classic antihero in the tradition of some of Katharsisdrill's old heroes. First an foremost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabulous_Furry_Freak_Brothers" target="_blank">Gilbert Shelton</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Crumb" target="_blank">Robert Crumb</a> and the Danish cartoonist <a href="https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/deleuran_claus.htm" target="_blank">Claus Deleuran</a>, all more or less (in their own very idiosyncratic way), part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s" target="_blank">counter-culture movement</a> of the late sixties and the seventies. But times have changed and pot-smoking, beer-drinking, pussy-hunting hippies are not really going to translate easily into this well-dressed and well-behaved millennium.</p>

<h3>Contact and comments</h3>
<p>There are no blog-style comments on this site, and as it can be gathered from the topic of the comic, Katharsisdrill is not terribly fond of mainstream spy-services like Facebook and twitter, but it is possible to interact, question, criticize, and point out errors in the comic on a number of underground social medias.  </p>
